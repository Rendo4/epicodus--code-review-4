## Description

_Hello and thank you for viewing 'Next Level Pizzaria' application! This project uses concepts learned in my early weeks at epicodus. It combines HTML elements with bootstrap as well as a custom style sheet! The application will take a set of inputs and create a new object called pizzas to simulate creating an order of customizeable pizzas and return a cost based on your entries._

| Input      | Output     | 
| :---       |    |      
|           | | 
|          |  |

## TTD Specs
_Describe: newPizza.calucateCost()

Test: "It should add the value of price based off the size of the pizza."
Code: let newPizza = new Pizza(10,...);
newPizza.calculateCost();
Expected Output: newPizza.price = 7

Test: "It should adjust the price of the pizza based off multiple factors of the pizza such as size, stuffed crust, and amount of toppings"
Code: let newPizza = new Pizza (10, ...);
newPizza.toppings.push("pepperioni");  
Expected Output: newPizza.price = 9

_Describe: newOrder.addPizza()

Test: "It should store a created pizza inside the object Order, and inside the object pizzas"
Code: let newPizza = new Pizza("Ted",10,...);
let newOrder = new Order(); 
newOrder.addPizza(newPizza);
newOrder.pizzas["Ted"]
Expected Output: returns newPizza
